# Thesis
This work delves into the mathematical foundations and elaborates on a methodology for network
generation based on spectral properties of graph-associated matrices. First, a comprehensive mathe-
matical framework focusing on eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and matrix diagonalization was established.
Next, network theory was explored, detailing basic concepts, standard models for network genera-
tion, and the spectral properties of matrices related to graphs.
Then, the Spectral Graph Forge (SGF) method was introduced, leveraging these spectral prop-
erties to generate synthetic networks with the same community structure of a target one. Detailed
mathematical formulations and coding implementations are provided, demonstrating the application
of the method to both small and large networks. Finally, the algorithm was extended by introducing
new transformations, with the goal to broaden the range of global properties that can be preserved
in the synthetic network.
