# Abstract
My thesis researched on a methodology for generating networks with target global characteristics, exploiting a methodology first introduced by Baldesi, L., Markopoulou, A., & Butts, C. T. (2018) in their paper Spectral Graph Forge: Graph Generation Targeting Modularity. This algorithm exploits the spectral properties of matrices associated to graphs, generating networks that match the modularity of a target network, which is useful both for creating synthetic network data and for anonymizing existing networks. After deeply studying the mathematics behind the spectrum of matrices, I have analyzed the algorithm and extended it by incorporating new transformations to capture other global characteristics beyond modularity.
